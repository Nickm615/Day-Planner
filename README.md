Homework 5 Day Planner

This application allows a user to plan their day using color-coded text-input blocks corresponding to the hours of the work day. It uses moment.js to display the time in real time. It also tracks the current hour using moment.js globally. Then it compares the id of the text-input (which corresponds to its represented hour in military time) to color them based on past, present or future. It also saves user input to local storage.
